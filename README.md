# Gesture and Voice Control System  

A robust system that leverages **Azure Cognitive Services** for speech recognition and **MediaPipe** for gesture recognition, enabling intuitive voice commands and hand gesture controls.  

## Features  

- üé§ **Voice Commands**: Open and close applications using speech recognition.  
- üñêÔ∏è **Gesture Recognition**: Control the mouse cursor and perform clicks with hand gestures.  
- üñ•Ô∏è **User-Friendly GUI**: Includes a **Tkinter-based control panel** to start and stop speech and gesture recognition.

## Prerequisites  

Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:  
- **Python 3.9** or higher  
- Azure Cognitive Services Speech SDK  
- MediaPipe  
- OpenCV  
- PyAutoGUI  
- Tkinter

## Installation  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/jagdeeshjk/Hand_control.git 
cd Hand_control  
```  

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment  
```bash  
# On Windows  
python -m venv myenv  
source myenv/Scripts/activate  

# On macOS/Linux  
python -m venv myenv  
source myenv/bin/activate  
```  

### 3. Install Dependencies  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### 4. Configure Azure Cognitive Services  
1. Create an Azure Cognitive Services account.  
2. Obtain your Speech API Key and Region.  
3. Replace placeholders `YOUR-SPEECH-API-KEY` and `YOUR-LOCATION` in the following files:  
   - `APP.py`  
   - `test_def.py`
